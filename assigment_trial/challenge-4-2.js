// You need to make 3 async functions
// 1. getUserById : Takes a user ID and returns a promise that resolves with the user's data
// 2. fetchMultipleUsers : Takes an array of user IDs and returns a promise that resolves with an array of user data (here you need to use Promise.all)
// 3. displayUserData : Takes an array of user IDs and displays it in the console using console.log (here you must call fetchMultipleUsers)

// Don't delete code bellow and this code must be at the bottom of the file
module.exports = { getUserById, fetchMultipleUsers, displayUserData };
